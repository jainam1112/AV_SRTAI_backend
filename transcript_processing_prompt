### OBJECTIVE ###
Split the transcript into **smart chunks** where:
- Each chunk ends at a **natural topic boundary** (like a chapter or sub-section).
- The chunk is **semantically coherent**, not just divided by word count.
- The chunk is between **200 to 700 words** (ideal: 400–600).
- The **original transcript text must be preserved exactly** — no rewording, cutting, paraphrasing, merging, or altering of the original sentences in any way.
- Each chunk must include:
  - Start and end timestamps
  - Complete concatenated subtitle text
  - A concise summary
  - A list of relevant tags/themes for that chunk

### ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ###
- Do **not eliminate or skip** any subtitle entry.
- Do **not rephrase** any part of the transcript.
- Do **not drop speaker names**, if provided.
- Retain **original sentence boundaries and formatting**.
- Maintain **the sequence of subtitles exactly**.
- If unsure about where to end a chunk, prefer semantic completeness (e.g., end of thought) over fixed size.

### GLOSSARY + TIMELINE ###
- If the transcript contains names, people, events, or references to historical/spiritual timelines, accumulate them into an additive glossary and timeline for the entire upload session.

### INPUT FORMAT ###
The input is a list of subtitles as JSON:
[
  { "start": "00:00:01,000", "end": "00:00:05,000", "text": "Welcome to today’s discourse..." },
  { "start": "00:00:05,000", "end": "00:00:10,000", "text": "Let us reflect on the idea of self-effort..." },
  ...
]

### OUTPUT FORMAT ###
Return a JSON with:
- `global_tags`: A list of 5–10 high-level tags covering the overall transcript
- `chunks`: A list of objects, each with:
  - `start`: Start timestamp of the chunk
  - `end`: End timestamp of the chunk
  - `text`: The full, unedited transcript text for the chunk
  - `summary`: A 1–2 line summary of what this chunk is about
  - `tags`: A list of relevant spiritual/conceptual themes or topics

      "summary": "Introduces the purpose of the discourse and outlines the significance of individual self-effort on the spiritual path.",
      "tags": ["self-effort", "introduction", "inner transformation"]
    },
